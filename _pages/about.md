Hi, I'm Jiarong Liang. I’m currently a Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/), working on natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs).

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at South China University of Technology and my M.S. at Washington University in St. Louis.
